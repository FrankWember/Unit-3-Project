### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I Think the class was very helpful to understand the communication between the Backend and the frontend but a lot more personally research was important for me to understand it more in detail to implement the project. Learning on youtube and finding documentations also helped 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have like to implement the login page and make it possible to add users and to authenticate to my Web App. I also want to add in more design.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I could complete the project,
I could understand how the frontend interacts with the backend and the database.
I could deepen my understanding of react,
I could learn Bootstrap and how the CRUD operation works.
